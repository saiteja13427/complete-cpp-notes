# Errors

Types of errors

1. **Syntax Errors**: Errors occuring in syntax like, missing semicolon, missing brackets etc.

2. **Semantic Errors**: This is kind of senseless code which you write.
   Ex: like 16 = x which is not a correct statement.

3. **Linker Error**: These occur when you call a function but its definition is not available.

4. **Runtime Error**: These occur in runtime and are very dangerous.
   Ex: x/y when y is 0, memory leaks etc.

5. **Logic Errors**: These errors are mistakes wherein we want some behaviour but due to this logical error, we get something else.
   Ex: `if(a=b) where it should be if(a==b)`
